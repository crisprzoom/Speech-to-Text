# Speech-to-Text
#Created a Raspberry Pi-powered device that listens to a word, recognizes it, and displays its spelling on a small screen. My daughter was always asking how to spell words and I wanted a way for her to be able to see the word after thinking of how to spell it first.

Set up Raspberry Pi Zero W with necessary hardware components (microphone and small screen).
Install Raspberry Pi OS on the microSD card and set up Wi-Fi connection.
Write Python code to:
Capture audio input using a microphone module.
Use the SpeechRecognition library to convert speech to text.
Display the recognized text on a small screen.
Enable the Python script to run automatically at boot using systemd service.
Install the FLAC command-line application to resolve an error related to speech recognition.
